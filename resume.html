    <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>Photography is my art. Maxx is my name. A few years ago I picked up a camera, and havenâ€™t looked back since. What started as a hobby has turned into a career, photography has led me toward discovering new passions in both visual journalism and advertising. Every day I con-tinue learning and working to become the best multi-faceted artist I can be. My experience as a photographer gives me a unique perspective on visuals and design.
